 * $Date: 2003/03/24 15:58:54 $
 * $Revision: 1.14 $
 * 
 * @brief Breadth-First-Search (BFS) %algorithm.
 *
 * Encapsulates the BFS %algorithm together with all data
 * produced by it. There are a few parameters, which on the one
 * hand influence the behaviour of BFS (e.g. bfs::start_node) and
 * on the other hand toggle the storing of extra information,
 * such as the level-number of each %node. In detail these are: 
 *  - bfs::start_node 
 *    (default: an arbitrary %node will be chosen)
 *  - bfs::scan_whole_graph states whether BFS will be 
 *    continued in the unused part of the %graph, if not all
 *    nodes were touched at the end of BFS started at the start-%node.
 *    (default: disabled)
 *  - bfs::calc_level toggle storing of level-numbers for each
 *    %node, i.e. its distance from the start-%node.
 *    (default: disabled)
 *  - bfs::store_preds toggle storing the predecessor of each
 *    %node, i.e. the father in the BFS-tree. (default: disabled)
 *  - bfs::store_non_tree_edges toggle storing of all non_tree_edges
 *    (tree_edges are always stored) in a list and thus enable or disable
 *    iteration through all non_tree_edges.
 *    (default: disabled)
 *
 * @em Please @em note that the %algorithm always starts with the
 * given start-%node (if none was given, the first %node is chosen
 * and stored, thus after BFS the root of the tree is always
 * accesible via bfs::start_node) and continues until no more
 * unused nodes are reachable from already used ones. Thus if the
 * %graph isn't connected not @em all nodes will be reached. If 
 * bfs::scan_whole_graph isn't set the BFS stops here. If it is
 * set, the BFS will be continued with the next unused %node and
 * so on until all nodes were used.
 *
 * For further customization a few virtual functions, so called
 * handler, are called at crucial stages of the %algorithm. In
 * this basic implementation all of these handler are empty. So
 * if one wants to add only a few lines of code (e.g. some new
 * numbering) he is likely to take this class as base-class and
 * override the handler where neccessary. In detail these are
 * (please look at the source code to see where they are called):
 *    -  bfs::init_handler
 *    -  bfs::end_handler 
 *    -  bfs::popped_node_handler 
 *    -  bfs::finished_node_handler 
 *    -  bfs::unused_node_handler 
 *    -  bfs::used_node_handler 
 *    -  bfs::new_start_handler 
 *
 * @em Please @em note: We do @em not claim that the set of
 * handlers provided is sufficient in any way. So if you believe
 * that some new handler is needed urgently please let us know.
 *
 * There is a lot of information stored during BFS (e.g. nodes in
 * bfs-order, list of non-tree edges). Some of it can be obtained directly
 * by using the corresponding member-function (e.g.  bfs::bfs_num),
 * but all information that can be thought of as a list (e.g. nodes in
 * bfs-order) can be accessed through iterators. In detail these are (of
 * course depending on what options are chosen!): 
 *    -  bfs::bfs_iterator
 *    -  bfs::tree_edges_iterator
 *    -  bfs::non_tree_edges_iterator
 *    -  bfs::roots_iterator
