 * $Revision: 1.25 $
 * 
 * @brief Depth-First-Search (DFS) %algorithm 
 * 
 * Encapsulates the DFS %algoritm together with all the data
 * produced by a run of DFS. Since there exits so much different
 * things which one might want to calculate during a DFS this
 * class provides basically two different customization
 * features. First it is possible to take influence on the
 * behaviour of this %algortihm by changing some of the following
 * options:
 *  - dfs::start_node 
 *    (default: an arbitrary %node will be chosen)
 *  - dfs::scan_whole_graph states whether BFS will be 
 *    continued in the unused part of the %graph, if not all
 *    nodes were touched at the end of DFS started at the start-%node.
 *    (default: disabled)
 *  - dfs::calc_comp_num toggle storing of completion-numbers 
 *    for each %node, i.e. a numbering which reflects the order in which 
 *    nodes were @em finished. (default: disabled)
 *  - dfs::store_preds toggle storing the predecessor of each
 *    %node, i.e. the father in DFS-tree. (default: disabled)
 *  - dfs::store_non_tree_edges toggle storing of all non-tree-edges
 *    (tree-edges are always stored) in a list and thus enable or disable
 *    iteration through all non-tree-edges.
 *    (default: disabled)
 * 
 * But the trouble with most DFS-%algorithm is that one always
 * wants to add a little bit of code somewhere in the
 * %algorithm. And then there are only two ways to get this
 * done. The more efficient one (in terms of runtime) is to
 * implement the DFS anew and add the new code where
 * necessary. The other way (which is more efficient in terms of
 * code-writing) is to take the %algorithm as provided and run
 * through the list of nodes it returns (resulting in an extra
 * factor of 2).
 *
 * Our DFS-%algoritm class provides a new method to add small
 * pieces of code to the %algorithm: Handler. These are virtual
 * functions called at well-defined, important states of the
 * %algorithm (e.g. before a new recursive call). So the only
 * thing to do is to derive your extended DFS from this class and
 * to override the handlers where needed. In detail there are the
 * following handler supported (have a look at the source code
 * for details):
 *  - dfs::init_handler
 *  - dfs::end_handler 
 *  - dfs::entry_handler 
 *  - dfs::leave_handler
 *  - dfs::before_recursive_call_handler 
 *  - dfs::after_recursive_call_handler 
 *  - dfs::old_adj_node_handler
 *  - dfs::new_start_handler
 *
 * @em Please @em note: We do @em not claim that this set of handlers 
 * is sufficient in any way. So if you believe that some new handler is 
 * needed urgently please let us know.
 *
 * There is a lot of information stored during DFS (e.g. nodes in
 * dfs-order, list of non-tree-edges). Some of it can be obtained directly
 * by using the corresponding member-function (e.g. dfs::dfs_num),
 * but all information that can be thought of as a list (e.g. nodes in
 * dfs-order) can be accessed through iterators. In detail these are (of
 * course depending on what options are chosen!): 
 *  - dfs::dfs_iterator
 *  - dfs::tree_edges_iterator
 *  - dfs::non_tree_edges_iterator
 *  - dfs::roots_iterator
