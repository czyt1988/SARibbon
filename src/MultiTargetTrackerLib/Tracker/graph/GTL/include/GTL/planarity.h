 * $Revision: 1.22 $
 * 
 * @brief Tests if a %graph can be drawn on a plane without any %edge
 * crossings 
 * 
 * This class implements the Lempel-Even-Cederbaum %planarity test using
 * PQ-trees. In case the %graph is planar a planar embedding is obtained,
 * i.e. for each %node in the %graph an ordered adjacency list is calculated,
 * such that there exists a planar drawing in which all adjacent edges
 * around a %node apply to this order.
 *
 * If the %graph is not planar Kuratowski's famous theorem states that it
 * must contain a subgraph hoemeomorphic to either K5 (the complete %graph
 * with five nodes) or K3,3 (the complete bipartite %graph with three nodes
 * each side).  In this case the nodes and edges of the tested %graph that
 * form either of these two are calculated.
 *
 * In case the %graph is planar and has @f$N@f$ nodes the algorithm needs
 * @f$\mathcal{O}(N)@f$ time for the test (including the planar embedding).
 * In case the %graph isn't planar it needs at most @f$\mathcal{O}(E)@f$
 * time if @f$E@f$ is the number of edges for both the test and the
 * detection of K5 or K3,3.
